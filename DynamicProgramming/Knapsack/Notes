DP

3 Types

1. Fractional Knapsack.   — >This is greedy approach
2. 0/1 Knapsack.  —> Either we will take 1 time this item or 0 time
3. Unbounded knapsack. —> In this item can be picked up any number of times

0/1 Knapsack can be done in three ways

N is number of items
W is the Total weight of knapsack

Normal Recursion.  — TC — O(2^N) SC — O(N)
Recursion with Memoization. — TC —>  O(N*W).  SC —>  O(N*W) + O(N)   —> O(M*N) for the matrix which we created with initialised as -1 and
Top Down Approach DP —> TC —>  O(N*W)  , SC —> O(N*W)

For MAtrix take the parameters which are changing like Weight and Numer of elements
W, N
And matrix size would be always [N+1][W+1]
